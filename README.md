# Welcome to my repo of Data Science projectsüë®‚Äçüéì

### List of projects in this repo:
  - ### **Analysis on Corona Virus using SQL**

  - ### **Weather Application using Tkinter**


## Detailed Description :-

  1. Analysis on Corona Virus using SQL
      - In this project I have used 3-4 years(2019-22) of Covid19.
      - Using my knowledge of SQL , I have performed **Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)**.
      - I have created 2 SQL tables. First table will contains the total death details all over the world. Second table contains the vaccination details.
      - Initially I have find the total test cases in India as well as in US.
      - Next I have find the _Death Percentage_ (Total Cases vs Total Death) in India.
      


  2. Weather Application using Tkinter
      - In this project I have created a Weather application using Python GUI toolkit **Tkinter**.
      - Here I used **requests & bs4(BeautifullSoup)** for scraping the data from Google Search.
      - For excuting this app first you need to clone this repo. Run the following GIT command or you can copy the **weather_app.py** code in you editor directly.
      ```
       git clone https://github.com/Vicky-Raghuwanshi07/DA-DS_Projects.git
      ```
      - After running weather_app.py you will see a pop-up interface on you PC/Laptop screen.
      - You can see a text box where you have to enter the city/state name for which you need to see the temperature (in Celsisus).
